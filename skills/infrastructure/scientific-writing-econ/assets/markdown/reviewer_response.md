Dear Editor and Referees,

Thank you for the opportunity to revise and resubmit our manuscript and for
the constructive feedback. We have carefully addressed all comments and believe
the paper is substantially improved as a result.

MAJOR COMMENTS

Comment 1: [Quote or paraphrase the referee's comment in italics]

Response: [Your response]

[Explain what you did and why. Be specific. Include page/table/figure references.]

Changes in manuscript:
- Page X: [Specific change]
- Table Y: [Specific change]
- New Appendix section Z: [What you added]

Comment 2: [Quote or paraphrase]

Response: [Your response]

[If you disagree, explain respectfully why. Provide evidence or reasoning.
Offer an alternative if you can't implement their suggestion.]

Example disagreement:
"We appreciate this suggestion. However, implementing [X] is not feasible
because [specific reason: data limitation, identification issue, scope].
Instead, we have [alternative approach] which addresses the underlying
concern by [explanation]. We are happy to discuss this further if the
referee feels strongly about this point."

## Common Response Patterns

### Agreeing and Implementing

```
Comment: [Referee suggests adding robustness check X]

Response: Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We have implemented [X] and
report the results in new Table A3 in the Online Appendix. Reassuringly, our
main findings remain qualitatively unchanged: the coefficient on [treatment]
is [new value] (SE = [value]), compared to [original value] in our baseline.
We now discuss this robustness check on page X.
```

### Partial Agreement

```
Comment: [Referee suggests major change that would fundamentally alter paper]

Response: We appreciate this thoughtful suggestion. We have partially
implemented this by [specific action]. However, fully implementing [suggestion]
would require [issue], which is beyond the scope of the current paper because
[reason]. We have added a discussion of this limitation and how future work
might address it (see page X, footnote Y).
```

### Respectful Disagreement

```
Comment: [Referee misunderstands or suggests something problematic]

Response: Thank you for raising this point. We believe there may be a
misunderstanding that we should clarify. [Explanation of your reasoning,
referencing specific pages/sections of original manuscript.]

To make this clearer in the revised version, we have:
1. [Clarification 1]
2. [Clarification 2]

We hope this addresses the referee's concern. If the underlying issue is
different from what we understood, we would be happy to address it in a
subsequent revision.
```

### Cannot Implement (with Alternative)

```
Comment: [Referee requests data/analysis you cannot provide]

Response: We appreciate this suggestion, which would indeed strengthen the
paper. Unfortunately, [specific reason why this is not possible: data
restrictions, computational limitations, out of scope]. However, we have
addressed the underlying concern by:

1. [Alternative analysis that addresses the same issue]
2. [Discussion acknowledging the limitation]
3. [Reference to how future work might address this]

The new analysis is reported in [Table/Figure X] and discussed on pages Y-Z.
```

### Conflicting Referee Comments

```
Comment: [Referee 1 suggests X; Referee 2 suggests opposite of X]

Response: We note that Referee 1 suggested [X] while Referee 2 suggested
[not-X]. After careful consideration, we have followed [chosen approach]
because [reasoning]. We believe this best serves the paper's main contribution.
We are, of course, happy to modify this if the Editor prefers the alternative
approach.

## Substantive Response Examples

### Adding a Robustness Check

```
Comment: The authors should test whether results are robust to using
alternative bandwidth choices in their RD design.

Response: Thank you for this important suggestion. We have added a
comprehensive bandwidth sensitivity analysis. Figure A2 in the new Online
Appendix plots our main coefficient estimate for bandwidths ranging from
0.5 to 5 years around the cutoff. The estimate is remarkably stable across
this range, with point estimates between [range]. The CCT optimal bandwidth
of [X years] falls well within this range. We discuss this analysis on page
Y of the revised manuscript.
```

### Clarifying Identification

```
Comment: I am concerned about [specific threat to identification]. How do the
authors address this?

Response: Thank you for highlighting this concern, which is central to our
identification strategy. We address it in three ways:

First, [theoretical/institutional argument].

Second, [empirical test you already included, now highlighted more clearly].

Third, we have added [new test directly addressing this concern]. Results,
reported in Table A4, show [findings]. This suggests [interpretation that
supports your identification].

We have substantially expanded our discussion of identification (pages X-Y)
to make these points clearer.
```

### Addressing Mechanism Questions

```
Comment: The paper provides reduced-form evidence but does not explore
mechanisms. Can the authors provide evidence on what drives the effect?

Response: Thank you for this suggestion. We have added a new section (Section
5.3, pages X-Y) exploring mechanisms. We consider three potential channels:

1. [Mechanism 1]: We test this by [approach]. Results in Table 5, Column 1
   suggest [finding].

2. [Mechanism 2]: We test this by [approach]. Results in Table 5, Column 2
   show [finding].

3. [Mechanism 3]: We test this by [approach]. Results in Table 5, Column 3
   indicate [finding].

While we cannot definitively rule out alternative mechanisms, the pattern of
results is most consistent with [preferred mechanism] because [reasoning].
