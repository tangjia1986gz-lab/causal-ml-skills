# Writing Abstracts for Economics Papers

## The Purpose of an Abstract

The abstract is often the **only** part of your paper that people read. It must:
1. Convey the importance of your question
2. Explain your approach
3. State your main findings
4. Signal the contribution

**Target length**: 100-200 words (check journal requirements)

## The Five-Sentence Abstract

A proven formula for clear, effective abstracts:

### Sentence 1: Context/Motivation
Why does this question matter?

```
"Understanding how education affects earnings is fundamental to
human capital theory and education policy."
```

### Sentence 2: Gap/Question
What specific question do you address?

```
"Yet identifying the causal effect of education is challenging
because ability is unobserved and correlated with schooling."
```

### Sentence 3: Approach
How do you address the question?

```
"We exploit discontinuities in school entry age cutoffs across
states to isolate exogenous variation in years of schooling."
```

### Sentence 4: Results
What did you find? (Include numbers!)

```
"We find that an additional year of education increases earnings
by 9.2 percent, with effects concentrated among those from
disadvantaged backgrounds."
```

### Sentence 5: Implications
Why should readers care?

```
"These findings suggest that policies expanding educational
access can reduce earnings inequality, with a benefit-cost
ratio of approximately 3:1."
```

## Extended Abstract Structure (150-200 words)

For longer abstracts, expand the middle sections:

1. **Context** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Gap** (1 sentence)
3. **This paper** (1-2 sentences) - What you do
4. **Method summary** (1-2 sentences) - Key identification
5. **Main results** (2-3 sentences) - Core findings with numbers
6. **Implications** (1 sentence)

## Example Abstracts

### Example 1: Labor Economics (Good)

> Does the minimum wage reduce employment? This question has divided
> economists for decades, with conflicting evidence from different
> empirical approaches. We use administrative payroll data covering
> 1.2 million workers to examine employment effects of the 2019
> federal minimum wage increase, employing a difference-in-differences
> design comparing workers just above and below the new minimum. We
> find employment reductions of 1.4 percent (SE = 0.6) among affected
> workers, concentrated in the restaurant sector. However, earnings
> gains for those who remain employed exceed income losses from
> reduced employment, suggesting net welfare gains for minimum wage
> workers as a group.

**Why it works**:
- Clear question upfront
- Specific data and method
- Concrete numbers with standard errors
- Nuanced interpretation

### Example 2: Development Economics (Good)

> Can cash transfers reduce poverty in the long run, or do recipients
> return to baseline after transfers end? We conducted a randomized
> controlled trial in rural Kenya, providing unconditional cash
> transfers of $1,000 to 5,000 households and tracking outcomes over
> seven years. At year seven, treated households had 23 percent higher
> consumption (p < 0.01), 31 percent more business assets, and
> children with 0.4 additional years of schooling. Asset accumulation
> and business formation—not just direct spending—drive persistence.
> These findings suggest cash transfers can generate sustained poverty
> reduction through productive investment.

### Example 3: What NOT to Do

> This paper studies education. We use data and econometrics. Our
> results are interesting and have policy implications. The findings
> contribute to the literature. We conclude that more research is
> needed.

**Problems**:
- No specific question
- No method details
- No actual results
- Empty phrases
- No contribution

## Key Elements to Include

### Must Have:
- [ ] Research question or objective
- [ ] Data/setting (briefly)
- [ ] Method/identification strategy
- [ ] Main quantitative result(s) with numbers
- [ ] Interpretation/implication

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Mechanism or channel
- [ ] Heterogeneity findings
- [ ] Policy counterfactual
- [ ] Comparison to prior estimates

### Avoid:
- [ ] "This paper studies..." as first words
- [ ] Vague phrases ("interesting results")
- [ ] Jargon without context
- [ ] Results without numbers
- [ ] Overly technical methods description
- [ ] Excessive hedging

## Writing Tips

### Start Strong
**Weak**: "This paper examines the relationship between..."
**Strong**: "Does X cause Y? Understanding this relationship is crucial for..."

### Be Specific
**Weak**: "We find significant effects on outcomes."
**Strong**: "We find that X increases Y by 15 percent (SE = 3.2)."

### Include Standard Errors
Always report uncertainty:
```
"...increases earnings by 9.2 percent (SE = 1.4)..."
"...reduces employment by 2.3 percentage points (95% CI: 1.1-3.5)..."
```

### Interpret Magnitudes
```
"This effect—equivalent to the black-white earnings gap—suggests..."
"The 15 percent increase represents roughly one standard deviation..."
```

### Use Active Voice
**Weak**: "Evidence is found that suggests..."
**Strong**: "We find that X causes Y."

## Abstract Revision Checklist

After drafting, verify:

1. **First sentence test**: Does it hook the reader?
2. **Clarity test**: Would a non-specialist understand the question?
3. **Method test**: Is the identification strategy clear?
4. **Results test**: Are specific numbers included?
5. **So-what test**: Does it explain why findings matter?
6. **Length test**: Within journal limits?
7. **Standalone test**: Does it make sense without the paper?

## Common Mistakes

### 1. The Literature Review Abstract
```
Bad: "There is a large literature on X. Some find Y, others find Z.
This paper contributes to this literature by studying W."
```
→ Focus on YOUR contribution, not the literature

### 2. The Methods-Heavy Abstract
```
Bad: "We use a two-stage least squares instrumental variables
approach with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors clustered
at the state-year level, controlling for demographic covariates
and fixed effects..."
```
→ One sentence on method is enough

### 3. The Results-Free Abstract
```
Bad: "We find significant effects of X on Y. Results are robust
to alternative specifications. Implications are discussed."
```
→ Include actual numbers!

### 4. The Hedge-Heavy Abstract
```
Bad: "We tentatively suggest that there may be some evidence
consistent with a possible effect..."
```
→ State findings confidently (with uncertainty quantified)

## JEL Codes

Common codes for causal inference papers:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| C21 | Cross-Sectional Models |
| C23 | Panel Data Models |
| C26 | Instrumental Variables |
| C31 | Multiple Variables; RDD |
| J31 | Wage Level and Structure |
| I21 | Analysis of Education |
| I38 | Government Policy; Provision |

Include 2-4 JEL codes that best describe your paper's:
1. Method
2. Topic
3. Application area
