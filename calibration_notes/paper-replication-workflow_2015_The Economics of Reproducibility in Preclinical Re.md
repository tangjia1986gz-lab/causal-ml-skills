## 摘要

Low reproducibility rates within life science research undermine cumulative knowledge
production and contribute to both delays and costs of therapeutic drug development. An
analysis of past studies indicates that the cumulative (total) prevalence of irreproducible
preclinical research exceeds 50%, resulting in approximately US$28,000,000,000 (US
$28B)/year spent on preclinical research that is not reproducible—in the United States
alone. We outline a framework for solutions and a plan for long-term improvements in re-
producibility rates that will help to accelerate the discovery of life-saving therapies
and cures.
