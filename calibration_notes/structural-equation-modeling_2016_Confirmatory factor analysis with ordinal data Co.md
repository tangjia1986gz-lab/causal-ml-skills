nonconvergence (Forero, Maydeu-Olivares, & Gallardo-
Pujol, 2009). However, the impact of the number of categories
on parameter variability and adjusted standard error estimates
has not yet been examined using MLR and WLSMV with
larger numbers of categories (e.g., eight or ten). The number
of categories affects not only the distribution of the observed
ordinal variables, but also the possibility of treating ordinal
variables as approximately continuous. This extension can
help validate whether MLR is equally as good as WLSMV
in a CFA model when ordinal observed variables have more
than five response categories, and/or it can explore whether
the superiority of MLR over WSLMV can be reached with a
larger number of categories.
Fourth, MLR was developed to permit the parameter esti-
mation from nonnormality of continuous observed variables,
whereas WLSMV has been implemented in CFA models with
nonnormal observed data due to the categorical nature of mea-
surement (i.e., ordinal data), conditional on the assumption of
a continuous, normal underlying distribution in the popula-
tion. Although polychoric correlation estimates have shown
robustness against violation of the latent-normality assump-
tion (Coenders, Satorra, & Saris, 1997; Flora & Curran, 2004;
Micceri, 1989; Quiroga, 1992), what is not clearly known
from the current literature is the extent to which the precision
of WLSMV in estimating factor loadings, standard errors, and
chi-square statistics would be sustained. Therefore, the latent
distribution was manipulated by varying skewness and
kurtosis in the study. It could be expected that the effect of
the latent normality distribution violation would more likely
be salient for the performance of WLSMV than for that of
MLR, holding other experimental conditions equal.
Moreover, nonnormality, in the form of asymmetry observed
in psychometric measurements, has not been uncommon in
applied studies. Micceri (1989) found that only about 3 % of
the 125 observed distributions that he investigated were close
to normal or near symmetric, and over 80 % displayed at least
slight or moderate asymmetry. Therefore, in order to be more
realistic from an applied standpoint, this study also included
asymmetric observed distributions of ordinal variables in the
simulation design.
Finally, this study was designed to examine the effect of
sample size on the parameter estimates produced while
utilizing the two estimators, because researchers have noted
that a desirable sample size is known to be an important factor
in CFA models. A small sample may cause inaccurate param-
eter estimates and unstable standard errors, and may result in
nonconvergence and improper solutions, as well.
Method
Model specification
A Monte Carlo simulation study was carried out to com-
pare the effects of different configurations of latent re-
sponse distributions, numbers of categories, and sample
sizes on model parameter estimates, standard errors, and
chi-square test statistics in a c

was slightly superior to the performance of ML (Beauducel &
Herzberg, 2006); (2) WLSMV outperformed WLS across
most conditions (Flora & Curran, 2004); and (3) ULS was
found to produce more accurate and precise factor loadings
than did WLSMV, but it encountered a higher rate of model
nonconvergence (Forero, Maydeu-Olivares, & Gallardo-
Pujol, 2009). However, the impact of the number of categories
