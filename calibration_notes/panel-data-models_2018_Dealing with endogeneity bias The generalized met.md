## 摘要

Endogeneity bias can lead to inconsistent estimates and incorrect inferences, which may 
provide misleading conclusions and inappropriate theoretical interpretations. Sometimes such 
bias can even lead to coefficients having the wrong sign. Although this is a long-standing issue, 
it is now emerging in marking and management science, with high-ranked journals increasingly 
exploring the issue. In this paper, we methodologically demonstrate how to detect and deal 
with endogeneity issues in panel data. For illustration purposes, we used a dataset consisting 
of observations over a 15-year period (i.e., 2002 to 2016) from 101 UK listed companies and 
examined the direct effect of R&D expenditures, corporate governance, and firms’ 
characteristics on performance. Due to endogeneity bias, the result of our analyses indicates 
significant differences in findings reported under the ordinary least square (OLS) approach, 
fixed effects and the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimations. We also provide 
generic STATA commands that can be utilized by marketing researchers in implementing a 
GMM model that better controls for the three sources of endogeneity, namely, unobserved 
heterogeneity, simultaneity and dynamic endogeneity.

## 方法论/识别策略

3.1 Data and Sample Selection Procedures 
Researchers in the Journal of Marketing, and Journal of Marketing Research have been using 
panel data for many years (see for example, McAlister, Srinivasan, & Kim, 2007; Nierop 
Bronnenberg,  Paap, Wedel, & Franses. 2010; Ma, Ailawadi, Gauri, & Grewal, 2011; Sridhar, 
Germann, Kang, & Grewal, 2016; Han, Mittal & Zhang, 2017), while IMM researchers are still 
predominantly relying on the use of survey data. The emergence of business/financial databases 
(Bloomberg, Datastream, Thomson One, Compustat) provides more flexibility to marketing 
researchers to effectively utilize the marketing and product related data available in these
