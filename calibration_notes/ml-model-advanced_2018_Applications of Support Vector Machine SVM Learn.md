## 摘要

Machine learning with maximization (support) of separating margin (vector), called support vector machine (SVM) learning, is a powerful classification tool that has been used for cancer genomic classification or subtyping. Today, as advancements in high-throughput technologies lead to production of large amounts of genomic and epigenomic data, the classification feature of SVMs is expanding its use in cancer genomics, leading to the discovery of new biomarkers, new drug targets, and a better understanding of cancer driver genes. Herein we reviewed the recent progress of SVMs in cancer genomic studies. We intend to comprehend the strength of the SVM learning and its future perspective in cancer genomic applications.

## 方法论/识别策略

SVM is a powerful method for building a classifier. It aims
to create a decision boundary between two classes that
enables the prediction of labels from one or more feature
vectors (6). This decision boundary, known as the
hyperplane, is orientated in such a way that it is as far as
